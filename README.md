This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I have managed to build out and style the page according to the Sketch file. However when I was trying to connect to the data I was unable to successfully pull back what I wanted and initiate the search function. I have done this before with the redux connecting to the flickr api or using fetch to gather data from a json file. But this unfortunately stumped me and I could not figure it out.
